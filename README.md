# PAF_Project

This project is an interactive skill-sharing and learning platform focused on cooking. Users can create accounts, share recipe posts and tutorials, manage learning plans, track their cooking progress with dashboards, and engage with a supportive community through likes, comments, and notifications. Built with a secure REST API (Spring Boot) and a modern client app (React, MongoDB), it supports user management, content sharing with PDFs and media, and real-time engagement features.
